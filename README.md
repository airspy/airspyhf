# User mode driver for Airspy HF+ 

This repository contains host software (Linux/Windows) for Airspy HF+, a high performance software defined radio for the HF and VHF bands.

http://www.airspy.com/airspy-hf-plus

## How to build host software on Windows:

### For VisualStudio 2013 or later:

* `git clone https://github.com/airspy/airspyhf.git host`
* Download https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/download/v1.0.20/libusb-1.0.20.7z
* Extract **libusb-1.0.20.7z** to host directory
  * You should have **host\libusb-1.0.20**
* Download ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release.zip
* Extract **pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release.zip** to host directory
  * You should have **host\libpthread-2-9-1-win**
* Navigate to **src** and Launch **airspyhf.sln** with VisualStudio 2013 or later
* In Visual Studio, choose **Release**, **x86** or **x64** then **Build Solution**

### For MinGW:

`git clone https://github.com/airspy/airspyhf.git host`

`cd host`

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

Normal version:

`cmake ../ -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0/`

Debug version:

`cmake ../ -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0/`

`make`

`make install`


## How to build the host software on Linux:

### Prerequisites for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian):


`sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config`


### Build host software on Linux:

`wget https://github.com/airspy/airspyhf/archive/master.zip`

`unzip master.zip`

`cd airspyhf-master`

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON`

`make`

`sudo make install`

`sudo ldconfig`

Users of non-Debian-based distrbutions (Fedora, etc), or distributions that don't use the plugdev group may need to modify the udev rules file to use the [uaccess paradigm](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4288). This can be performed by editing the udev rules file:

`sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/52-airspyhf.rules` 

... and replacing the contents with: `ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="800c", SYMLINK+="airspyhf-%k", TAG+="uaccess"`
Device access should then work for users logging in locally, but may not work for ssh logins, or systemd services.

## Clean CMake temporary files/dirs:

`cd airspyhf-master/build`

`rm -rf *`
